# Sens Terms of Use
Please read the following terms and conditions carefully before subscribing to "Sens Monthly" or "Sens Annual", a service provided by "Sens" ("we", "us", "our") (the "Service").

Subscription
The service is a subscription-based, fee-based service, which means you will be paid in advance for future subscription usage. Currently you can choose to use the service on an annual, monthly, or buyout basis.

Towards the end of each subscription cycle, your subscription will automatically renew by default unless you explicitly cancel the automatic renewal yourself or we cancel the service. You can cancel the auto-renewal feature yourself through the "Manage Subscriptions" section of the service.

Free Plan
The free plan will be activated for users by default, offering a 15-day trial. Please try before subscribing or purchasing. We reserve the right to modify the number of trials and features for better service.

The free plan will not upgrade to paid plan by default.

Fees
When a price adjustment occurs, the new fee will be incurred on your next subscription cycle.

About Sens service's Word Count Limit
The 220,000-word limit provided by Sens service is based on an analysis of English texts. The actual number of words you may use could vary when operating in languages other than English.

Fair Use Policy
While our services are designed to be used without restrictions, the term "unlimited" is defined within the bounds of reasonable use by an average user. Our aim is to provide a high-quality service experience for all users, hence we implement a fair use policy to prevent potential degradation of service quality due to excessive use by a minority of users.

1. Usage Limits
   Our services are intended for personal and business customers to meet normal commercial purposes. "Unlimited usage" refers to normal, reasonable, non-automated use, meaning that automated scripts, malicious software, or any form of automated access is not considered permissible use.

2. Determination of Fair Use
   We reserve the right to determine what constitutes as exceeding fair use through automated algorithms or manual review. If a user's consumption significantly exceeds the standard of average user consumption, it will be considered as beyond fair use.

3. Consequences of Exceeding Fair Use
   Should we determine that a user's usage exceeds fair use, we may take reasonable measures including but not limited to limiting the user's service usage, temporarily or permanently suspending the service, or engaging with the user to find an appropriate solution. We will attempt to notify the user before taking any restrictive actions.

4. Policy Changes
   We reserve the right to modify this fair use policy at any time. Any such changes will be posted on our website, and significant changes will be communicated to users via email or in-service notifications.

Refunds
Subscriptions and one-time payments are non-refundable, so be sure to use the daily trial feature to ensure the service meets your needs before you purchase.

Contact Us
If you have any questions about this policy, you can send an email to support@ssenss.com to inquire, and we will promptly resolve your issue, usually within 5 business days.
